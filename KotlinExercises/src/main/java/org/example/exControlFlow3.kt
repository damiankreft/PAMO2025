/**
 * Write a program that simulates the Fizz buzz game.
 * Your task is to print numbers from 1 to 100 incrementally,
 * replacing any number divisible by three with the word
 * "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".
 * Any number divisible by both 3 and 5 must be replaced with the word "fizzbuzz".
 * Hint 1
 * Use a for loop to count numbers and a when expression to decide what to print at each step.
 * Hint 2
 * Use the modulo operator (%) to return the remainder of a number being divided.
 * Use the equality operator (==) to check if the remainder equals zero.
